  <title>Assignment</title>
  <p>Now that we have created some variables, we would like to store values in them. We do that with
    an <term>assignment statement</term>.</p>
  <program>
firstLetter = 'a';   // give firstLetter the value 'a'
hour = 11;           // assign the value 11 to hour
minute = 59;         // set minute to 59
</program>
  <p>This example shows three assignments, and the comments show three
    different ways people sometimes talk about assignment statements. The
    vocabulary can be confusing here, but the idea is straightforward:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When you make an assignment to a variable, you give it a value.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>A common way to represent variables on paper is to draw a box with the name of the variable on
    the outside and the value of the variable on the inside. This kind of figure is called a <term>state
    diagram</term> because is shows what state each of the variables is in (you can think of it as
    the variable's <q>state of mind</q>). This diagram shows the effect of the three assignment
    statements:</p>
  <figure align="center">
    <image source="Chapter2/Images/2.4statediagram.png"
           width="50%"
           alt="Three boxes. One labeled firstLetter containing 'a'. One labeled hour containing 11. One labeled minute containing 59."/>
  </figure>
  <p>I sometimes use different shapes to indicate different variable types.
    These shapes should help remind you that one of the rules in C++ is that
    a variable has to have the same type as the value you assign it.</p>
  <p>It can be useful to examine the <q>state of mind</q> of the computer
    as it runs code you have written. Programmers use <term>debuggers</term>
    to do so. In this book, you can use the <term>codelens</term> feature to
    run programs line by line.

  <activity label="state_of_mind">
    <statement>
      <p>Run the code sample below by using the <b>Next</b> button to advance line by line. As you do so,
      watch the area to the right to examine the <q>state of mind</q> of the computer as it runs the
      code.</p>
    </statement>
    <program interactive="codelens" xml:id="state_of_mind_ed">
  int main() {
    char firstLetter;
    firstLetter = 'a';   // give firstLetter the value 'a'
    int hour;
    hour = 11;           // assign the value 11 to hour
    int minute;
    minute = 59;         // set minute to 59
  }
    </program>
  </activity>
  <warning>
    <p>The variable type that you declare must match the type of the value
      assigned to it. A type mismatch will generate a compile error.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>For example, you cannot store a string in an <c>int</c> variable. The following statement
    generates a compile error.</p>
  <program>int hour;
hour = "Hello.";       // WRONG !!</program>
  <p>This rule is sometimes a source of confusion, because there are many
    ways that you can convert values from one type to another, and C++
    sometimes converts things automatically. But for now you should remember
    that as a general rule variables and values have the same type, and
    we'll talk about special cases later.</p>
  <p>Another source of confusion is that some strings <em>look</em> like integers, but they are not.
    For example, the string <q>123</q>, which is made up of the characters 1, 2 and 3, is not the
    same thing as the <em>number</em> 123. This assignment is illegal:</p>
  <program>int minute = "59";         // WRONG!</program>
