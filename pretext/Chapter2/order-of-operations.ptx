  <title>Order of Operations</title>
  <p>When more than one operator appears in an expression the order of evaluation depends on the
    rules of <term>precedence</term>. A complete explanation of precedence can get complicated, but
    just to get you started:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. So <c>2 * 3 - 1</c> yields 5,
          not 4, and <c>2 / 3 - 1</c> yields -1, not 1 (remember that in integer division <c>2/3</c> is 0).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the operators have the same precedence they are evaluated from left to right. So in
          the expression <c>minute * 100 / 60</c>, the multiplication happens first, yielding <c>5900 / 60</c>, which in turn
          yields 98. If the operations had gone from right to left, the result would be 59 * 1 which
          is 59, which is wrong.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any time you want to override the rules of precedence (or you are not sure what they are)
          you can use parentheses. Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, so <c>2 * (3 - 1) is 4</c>. You
          can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in <c>(minute * 100) / 60</c>, even though
          it doesn't change the result.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p><c>1 + 5</c> is the only operation remaining. I'm not going to ask you any questions about it.
    However, it's important that you can wrap you head around the fact that the <c>+</c> operator
    appeared <term>
      first</term> in the calculation, but it was the <term>last</term> operator to be evaluated.
    The order of operations can be kind of confusing at times, but I think you've got a good grasp
    of the concept!</p>
