  <title>Operators for Characters</title>
  <p>Interestingly, the same mathematical operations that work on integers
    also work on characters. For example, observe the output of the following program.</p>
  <listing label="char_operations_AC_1">
    <caption>
      <p>This program performs character addition.</p>
    </caption>
    <program xml:id="char_operations_AC_1_editor"
             interactive="activecode"
             language="cpp"
             line-numbers="yes">
      <input><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    char letter;
    letter = 'a' + 1;
    cout << letter << endl;
}
        ]]></input>
    </program>
  </listing>
  
  <p>Computing <c>'a' + 1</c> converts
    the character <c>'a'</c> to ASCII, adds 1 to this value, then converts the
    result from ASCIIs back to a character.</p>
  <p>Although it is syntactically legal to multiply characters, it is almost never
    useful to do it.</p>
  <p>Earlier I said that you can only assign integer values to integer
    variables and character values to character variables, but that is not
    completely true. In some cases, C++ converts automatically between
    types. For example, the following is legal.</p>
  <listing label="char_operations_AC_2">
    <caption>
      <p>This program performs automatic type converstion. It converts <c>'a'</c>
        to its ASCII value.</p>
    </caption>
    <program xml:id="char_operations_AC_2_editor"
             interactive="activecode"
             language="cpp"
             line-numbers="yes">
      <input><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    int number;
    number = 'a';
    cout << number << endl;
}
        ]]></input>
    </program>
  </listing>
  <p>The result is 97, which is the number that is used internally by C++ to
    represent the letter <c>'a'</c>. However, it is generally a good idea to treat
    characters as characters, and integers as integers, and only convert
    from one to the other if there is a good reason.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Characters in C++ hold <url href="https://www.ascii-code.com/ASCII">ASCII</url> values, which range from 0 to 128. Uppercase
      &#x2018;A' has an ASCII value of 65, lowercase &#x2018;a' has a value of 97, and a space has a
      value of 32. C++ converts characters to their ASCII values to perform automatic type
      conversion and character arithmetic.</p>
  </note>
  <p>Automatic type conversion is an example of a common problem in designing a programming
    language, which is that there is a conflict between <term>formalism</term>, which is the
    requirement that formal languages should have simple rules with few exceptions, and <term>
    convenience</term>, which is the requirement that programming languages be easy to use in
    practice.</p>
  <p>More often than not, convenience wins, which is usually good for expert
    programmers, who are spared from rigorous but unwieldy formalism, but
    bad for beginning programmers, who are often baffled by the complexity
    of the rules and the number of exceptions. In this book I have tried to
    simplify things by emphasizing the rules and omitting many of the
    exceptions.</p>
