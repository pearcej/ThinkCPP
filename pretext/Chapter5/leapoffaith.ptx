  <title>Leap of faith</title>
  <p>Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but as you
            saw in the previous section, it can quickly become labarynthine. An
            alternative is what I call the <q>leap of faith.</q></p>
  <note>
    <p>When you come to a function call, instead of following the
                flow of execution, you <em>assume</em> that the function works correctly
                and returns the appropriate value.  This is the <term>leap of faith</term>.</p>
  </note>
  <p>In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use
            built-in functions. When you call &#x2018;'cos'' or &#x2018;'exp'', you don't examine the
            implementations of those functions. You just assume that they work,
            because the people who wrote the built-in libraries were good
            programmers.</p>
  <p>Well, the same is true when you call one of your own functions. For
            example, in <number_reference internal="True" refuri="boolfunctions#bool" title="Section %s"><inline classes="std std-numref">Section 5.8</inline></number_reference> we wrote a function called
            &#x2018;'isSingleDigit'' that determines whether a number is between 0 and 9. Once
            we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct&#x2014;by testing and
            examination of the code&#x2014;we can use the function without ever looking at
            the code again.</p>
  <p>The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive
            call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should <em>assume</em>
            that the recursive call works (yields the correct result), and then ask
            yourself, <q>Assuming that I can find the factorial of <math>n-1</math>, can I
            compute the factorial of <math>n</math>?</q> In this case, it is clear that you
            can, by multiplying by <math>n</math>.</p>
  <p>Of course, it is a bit strange to assume that the function works
            correctly when you have not even finished writing it, but that's why
            it's called a leap of faith!</p>
  <exercise label="recursive_leap_1">
    <statement>
      <p>Which of the following is an example of the recursive leap of faith?</p>
    </statement>
    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>Since you can find the factorial of the first 3 numbers in a list, you must also be able to find the factorial of the first 2.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>There is no leap of faith here.  In fact, it's quite flip-flopped.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>You assume that the log function works, without examining the implementation.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>This is a leap of faith, but it is not recursive.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>Since you can take the sum of the first 7 numbers in a list, you assume that you can also take the sum of the first 8.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Recursive leaps of faith always assume that the recursive call will work.</p>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>You write a function and assume that it will work.</p>
