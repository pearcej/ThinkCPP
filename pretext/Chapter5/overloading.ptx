  <title>Overloading</title>
  <p>In the previous section you might have noticed that <c>fred</c> and <c>area</c>
            perform similar functions&#x2014;finding the area of a circle&#x2014;but take
            different parameters. For <c>area</c>, we have to provide the radius; for <c>fred</c>,
            we provide two points.</p>
  <p>If two functions do the same thing, it is natural to give them the same
            name. In other words, it would make more sense if <c>fred</c> were called <c>area</c>.</p>
  <p>Having more than one function with the same name, which is called
            <term>overloading</term>, is legal in C++ <em>as long as each version takes
                different parameters</em>. So we can go ahead and rename <c>fred</c>:</p>
  <pre>double area (double xc, double yc, double xp, double yp) {
  return area (distance (xc, yc, xp, yp));
}</pre>
  <p>This looks like a recursive function, but it is not. Actually, this
            version of <c>area</c> is calling the other version. When you call an
            overloaded function, C++ knows which version you want by looking at the
            arguments that you provide. If you write:</p>
  <pre>double x = area (3.0);</pre>
  <p>C++ goes looking for a function named <c>area</c> that takes a double as an
            argument, and so it uses the first version. If you write</p>
  <pre>double x = area (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0);</pre>
  <p>C++ uses the second version of <c>area</c>.</p>
  <p>Many of the built-in C++ commands are overloaded, meaning that there are
            different versions that accept different numbers or types of parameters.</p>
  <warning>
    <p>Although overloading is a useful feature, it should be used with
                caution. You might get yourself nicely confused if you are trying to
                debug one version of a function while accidentally calling a different
                one.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>Actually, that reminds me of one of the cardinal rules of debugging:
            <term>make sure that the version of the program you are looking at is the
                version of the program that is running!</term> Some time you may find
            yourself making one change after another in your program, and seeing the
            same thing every time you run it. This is a warning sign that for one
            reason or another you are not running the version of the program you
            think you are. To check, stick in an output statement (it doesn't matter
            what it says) and make sure the behavior of the program changes
            accordingly.</p>
