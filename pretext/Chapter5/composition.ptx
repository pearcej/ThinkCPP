  <title>Composition</title>
  <p>As you should expect by now, once you define a new function, you can use
            it as part of an expression, and you can build new functions using
            existing functions. For example, what if someone gave you two points,
            the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and asked for the
            area of the circle?</p>
  <p>Let's say the center point is stored in the variables <c>xc</c> and <c>yc</c>, and the
            perimeter point is in <c>xp</c> and <c>yp</c>. The first step is to find the radius of
            the circle, which is the distance between the two points. Fortunately,
            we have a function, <c>distance</c>, that does that.</p>
  <pre>double radius = distance (xc, yc, xp, yp);</pre>
  <p>The second step is to find the area of a circle with that radius, and
            return it.</p>
  <pre>double result = area (radius);
return result;</pre>
  <p>Wrapping that all up in a function, we get:</p>
  <pre>double fred (double xc, double yc, double xp, double yp) {
  double radius = distance (xc, yc, xp, yp);
  double result = area (radius);
  return result;
}</pre>
  <p>The name of this function is <c>fred</c>, which may seem odd. I will explain
            why in the next section.</p>
  <p>The temporary variables radius and area are useful for development and
            debugging, but once the program is working we can make it more concise
            by composing the function calls:</p>
  <pre>double fred (double xc, double yc, double xp, double yp) {
  return area (distance (xc, yc, xp, yp));
}</pre>
  <exercise label="fun_comp_AC_1">
    <statement>
      <p>This program shows you how the distance and area functions are
            composed in the fred function to calculate the area of a circle
            if we only know the coordinates of the center, and one other point
            of the circle.</p>

  <p>Function composition is not limited to a fixed number of calls.
            Multiple calls can be made to the same function as well as to a number of
            different functions.</p>
