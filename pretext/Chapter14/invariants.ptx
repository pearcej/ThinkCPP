  <title>Invariants</title>
  <p>There are several conditions we expect to be true for a proper
            <c>Complex</c> object. For example, if the <c>cartesian</c> flag is set then
            we expect <c>real</c> and <c>imag</c> to contain valid data. Similarly, if
            <c>polar</c> is set, we expect <c>mag</c> and <c>theta</c> to be valid. Finally,
            if both flags are set then we expect the other four variables to be
            consistent; that is, they should be specifying the same point in two
            different formats.</p>
  <p>These kinds of conditions are called <c>invariants</c>, for the obvious
            reason that they do not vary&#x2014;they are always supposed to be true. One of
            the ways to write good quality code that contains few bugs is to figure
            out what invariants are appropriate for your classes, and write code
            that makes it impossible to violate them.</p>
  <p>One of the primary things that data encapsulation is good for is helping
            to enforce invariants. The first step is to prevent unrestricted access
            to the instance variables by making them private. Then the only way to
            modify the object is through accessor functions and modifiers. If we
            examine all the accessors and modifiers, and we can show that every one
            of them maintains the invariants, then we can prove that it is
            impossible for an invariant to be violated.</p>
  <p>Looking at the <c>Complex</c> class, we can list the functions that make
            assignments to one or more instance variables:</p>
  <pre>the second constructor
calculateCartesian
calculatePolar
setCartesian
setPolar</pre>
  <p>In each case, it is straightforward to show that the function maintains
            each of the invariants I listed. We have to be a little careful, though.
            Notice that I said <q>maintain</q> the invariant. What that means is <q>If the
            invariant is true when the function is called, it will still be true
            when the function is complete.</q></p>
  <p>That definition allows two loopholes. First, there may be some point in
            the middle of the function when the invariant is not true. That's ok,
            and in some cases unavoidable. As long as the invariant is restored by
            the end of the function, all is well.</p>
  <p>The other loophole is that we only have to maintain the invariant if it
            was true at the beginning of the function. Otherwise, all bets are off.
            If the invariant was violated somewhere else in the program, usually the
            best we can do is detect the error, output an error message, and exit.</p>
