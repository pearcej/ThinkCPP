  <title>Complex numbers</title>
  <p>As a running example for the rest of this chapter we will consider a
            class definition for complex numbers. Complex numbers are useful for
            many branches of mathematics and engineering, and many computations are
            performed using complex arithmetic. A complex number is the sum of a
            real part and an imaginary part, and is usually written in the form
            <math>x + yi</math>, where <math>x</math> is the real part, <math>y</math> is the
            imaginary part, and <math>i</math> represents the square root of -1.</p>
  <p>The following is a class definition for a user-defined type called
            <c>Complex</c>:</p>
  <program>class Complex
{
  double real, imag;

public:
  Complex () { }
  Complex (double r, double i) { real = r;  imag = i; }
};</program>
  <p>Because this is a <c>class</c> definition, the instance variables <c>real</c>
            and <c>imag</c> are private, and we have to include the label <c>public:</c>
            to allow client code to invoke the constructors.</p>
  <p>As usual, there are two constructors: one takes no parameters and does
            nothing; the other takes two parameters and uses them to initialize the
            instance variables.</p>
  <p>So far there is no real advantage to making the instance variables
            private. Let's make things a little more complicated; then the point
            might be clearer.</p>
  <p>There is another common representation for complex numbers that is
            sometimes called <q>polar form</q> because it is based on polar coordinates.
            Instead of specifying the real part and the imaginary part of a point in
            the complex plane, polar coordinates specify the direction (or angle) of
            the point relative to the origin, and the distance (or magnitude) of the
            point.</p>
  <p>The following figure shows the two coordinate systems graphically.</p>
  <figure align="center" xml:id="empty-108">
    <image source="Chapter14/Images/14.3polar_and_cartesian.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
  </figure>
  <p>Complex numbers in polar coordinates are written <math>r e^{i \theta}</math>,
            where <math>r</math> is the magnitude (radius), and <math>\theta</math> is the
            angle in radians.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Fortunately, it is easy to convert from one form to another. To go from
                Cartesian to polar,</p>
    <math_block docname="Chapter14/complex_numbers" label="True" nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">\begin{aligned}
r       &amp; = &amp;  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
\theta  &amp; = &amp;  \arctan (y / x)\end{aligned}</math_block>
    <p>To go from polar to Cartesian,</p>
    <math_block docname="Chapter14/complex_numbers" label="True" nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">\begin{aligned}
x       &amp; = &amp;  r \cos \theta \\
y       &amp; = &amp;  r \sin \theta\end{aligned}</math_block>
  </note>
  <p>So which representation should we use? Well, the whole reason there are
            multiple representations is that some operations are easier to perform
            in Cartesian coordinates (like addition), and others are easier in polar
            coordinates (like multiplication). One option is that we can write a
            class definition that uses <em>both</em> representations, and that converts
            between them automatically, as needed.</p>
  <program>class Complex
{
  double real, imag;
  double mag, theta;
  bool cartesian, polar;

public:
  Complex () { cartesian = false;  polar = false; }

  Complex (double r, double i)
  {
    real = r;  imag = i;
    cartesian = true;  polar = false;
  }
};</program>
  <p>There are now six instance variables, which means that this
            representation will take up more space than either of the others, but we
            will see that it is very versatile.</p>
  <p>Four of the instance variables are self-explanatory. They contain the
            real part, the imaginary part, the angle and the magnitude of the
            complex number. The other two variables, <c>cartesian</c> and <c>polar</c> are
            flags that indicate whether the corresponding values are currently
            valid.</p>
  <p>For example, the do-nothing constructor sets both flags to false to
            indicate that this object does not contain a valid complex number (yet),
            in either representation.</p>
  <p>The second constructor uses the parameters to initialize the real and
            imaginary parts, but it does not calculate the magnitude or angle.
            Setting the <c>polar</c> flag to false warns other functions not to access
            <c>mag</c> or <c>theta</c> until they have been set.</p>
  <p>Now it should be clearer why we need to keep the instance variables
            private. If client programs were allowed unrestricted access, it would
            be easy for them to make errors by reading uninitialized values. In the
            next few sections, we will develop accessor functions that will make
            those kinds of mistakes impossible.</p>

      <p>Take a look at the active code below, which demonstrates the separation of
            interface and implementation using classes. In this code, we create a <c>Triangle</c>
            object which is represented by three sides. In <c>main</c>, we print out the perimeter of
            the triangle, which should be 12.</p>

      <p>Now take a look at this second piece of active code. What if we decide we want
            to represent a <c>Triangle</c> in a different way? Because the way we represent a
            <c>Triangle</c> is private, we can easily change the implementation while keeping
            the interface the same. Now, <c>Triangle</c> is represented by two sides and the
            angle between them. Notice how our <c>main</c> function is the exact same as before.</p>
