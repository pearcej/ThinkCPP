  <title>A histogram</title>
  <p>It is often useful to take the data from the previous tables and store them for later access,
    rather than just print them. What we need is a way to store 10 integers. We could create 10
    integer variables with names like <c>howManyOnes</c>, <c>howManyTwos</c>, etc. But that would require a lot of typing,
    and it would be a real pain later if we decided to change the range of values.</p>
  <p>A better solution is to use a vector with size 10. That way we can
    create all ten storage locations at once and we can access them using
    indices, rather than ten different names. Here's how:</p>

  <program>int numValues = 100000;
int upperBound = 10;
vector&lt;int&gt; vector = randomVector(numValues, upperBound);
vector&lt;int&gt; histogram(upperBound);

for (int i = 0; i &lt; upperBound; i++) {
  int count = howMany(vector, i);
  histogram[i] = count;
}</program>

  <p>I called the vector <term>histogram</term> because that's a statistical term for a vector of
    numbers that counts the number of appearances of a range of values.</p>
  <p>The tricky thing here is that I am using the loop variable in two different ways. First, it is
    an argument to <c>howMany</c>, specifying which value I am interested in. Second, it is an index into
    the histogram, specifying which location I should store the result in.</p>
