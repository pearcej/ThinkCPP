  <title>A histogram</title>
  <p>It is often useful to take the data from the previous tables and store
            them for later access, rather than just print them. What we need is a
            way to store 10 integers. We could create 10 integer variables with
            names like <c>howManyOnes</c>, <c>howManyTwos</c>, etc. But that would require
            a lot of typing, and it would be a real pain later if we decided to
            change the range of values.</p>
  <p>A better solution is to use a vector with size 10. That way we can
            create all ten storage locations at once and we can access them using
            indices, rather than ten different names. Here's how:</p>
  <pre>int numValues = 100000;
int upperBound = 10;
vector&lt;int&gt; vector = randomVector (numValues, upperBound);
vector&lt;int&gt; histogram (upperBound);

for (int i = 0; i &lt; upperBound; i++) {
  int count = howMany (vector, i);
  histogram[i] = count;
}</pre>
  <p>I called the vector <term>histogram</term> because that's a statistical term for
            a vector of numbers that counts the number of appearances of a range of
            values.</p>
  <p>The tricky thing here is that I am using the loop variable in two
            different ways. First, it is an argument to <c>howMany</c>, specifying
            which value I am interested in. Second, it is an index into the
            histogram, specifying which location I should store the result in.</p>
