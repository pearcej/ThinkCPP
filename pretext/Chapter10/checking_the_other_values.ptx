  <title>Checking the other values</title>
  <p><c>howMany</c> only counts the occurrences of a particular value, and we
            are interested in seeing how many times each value appears. We can solve
            that problem with a loop:</p>
  <pre>int numValues = 20;
int upperBound = 10;
vector&lt;int&gt; vector = randomVector (numValues, upperBound);

cout &lt;&lt; "value\thowMany";

for (int i = 0; i &lt; upperBound; i++) {
  cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\t' &lt;&lt; howMany (vector, i) &lt;&lt; endl;
}</pre>
  <p>Notice that it is legal to declare a variable inside a <c>for</c>
            statement. This syntax is sometimes convenient, but you should be aware
            that a variable declared inside a loop only exists inside the loop. If
            you try to refer to <c>i</c> later, you will get a compiler error.</p>
  <p>This code uses the loop variable as an argument to <c>howMany</c>, in order
            to check each value between 0 and 9, in order. The result is:</p>
  <pre>value   howMany
0       2
1       1
2       3
3       3
4       0
5       2
6       5
7       2
8       0
9       2</pre>
  <p>Again, it is hard to tell if the digits are really appearing equally
            often. If we increase <c>numValues</c> to 100,000 we get the following:</p>
  <pre>value   howMany
0       10130
1       10072
2       9990
3       9842
4       10174
5       9930
6       10059
7       9954
8       9891
9       9958</pre>
  <p>In each case, the number of appearances is within about 1% of the
            expected value (10,000), so we conclude that the random numbers are
            probably uniform.</p>
