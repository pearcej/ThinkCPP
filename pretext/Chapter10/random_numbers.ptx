  <p>[pseudorandom]</p>
  <p>Most computer programs do the same thing every time they are executed,
            so they are said to be <term>deterministic</term>. Usually, determinism is a good
            thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the same result.
            For some applications, though, we would like the computer to be
            unpredictable. Games are an obvious example.</p>
  <p>Making a program truly <term>nondeterministic</term> turns out to be not so easy,
            but there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of
            them is to generate pseudorandom numbers and use them to determine the
            outcome of the program. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random in the
            mathematical sense, but for our purposes, they will do.</p>
  <p>C++ provides a function called <c>random</c> that generates pseudorandom
            numbers. It is declared in the header file <c>cstdlib</c>, which contains a
            variety of <q>standard library</q> functions, hence the name.</p>
  <p>The return value from <c>random</c> is an integer between 0 and
            <c>RAND_MAX</c>, where <c>RAND_MAX</c> is a large number (about 2 billion on
            my computer) also defined in the header file. Each time you call
            <c>random</c> you get a different randomly-generated number. To see a
            sample, run this loop:</p>
  <exercise label="random_numbers_AC_1">
    <statement>
      <p>Take a look at the active code below, which generates 4 random numbers.</p>
    </statement>
    <program xml:id="random_numbers_AC_1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="cpp">
      <input><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        int x = random ();
        cout << x << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
        ]]></input>

  <p>On my machine I got the following output:</p>
  <pre>1804289383
846930886
1681692777
1714636915</pre>
  <p>You will probably get something similar, but different, on yours.</p>
  <p>Of course, we don't always want to work with gigantic integers. More
            often we want to generate integers between 0 and some upper bound. A
            simple way to do that is with the modulus operator. For example:</p>
  <pre>int x = random ();
int y = x % upperBound;</pre>
  <p>Since <c>y</c> is the remainder when <c>x</c> is divided by <c>upperBound</c>,
            the only possible values for <c>y</c> are between 0 and <c>upperBound - 1</c>,
            including both end points.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Keep in mind, though, that <c>y</c> will never be equal to <c>upperBound</c>.</p>

  <exercise label="random_numbers_AC_2">
    <statement>
      <p>The active code below generates random numbers between 1 and 7.</p>
    </statement>
    <program xml:id="random_numbers_AC_2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="cpp">
      <input><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    int upperBound = 8;
    cout << "Let's generate some random numbers between 0 and 7!" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        int x = random ();
        int y = x % upperBound;
        cout << y << " ";
    }
}

  <p>It is also frequently useful to generate random floating-point values. A
            common way to do that is by dividing by <c>RAND_MAX</c>. For example:</p>
  <pre>int x = random ();
double y = double(x) / RAND_MAX;</pre>
  <p>This code sets <c>y</c> to a random value between 0.0 and 1.0, including
            both end points. As an exercise, you might want to think about how to
            generate a random floating-point value in a given range; for example,
            between 100.0 and 200.0.</p>
  <exercise label="random_numbers_AC_3">
    <statement>
      <p>The active code below generates random numbers between 0 and 1. Can you modify it
            to generate random numbers between 100.0 and 200.0? If you're stuck you can
            reveal the hint below!</p>

    <p>The formula to generate random numbers between min and max is
