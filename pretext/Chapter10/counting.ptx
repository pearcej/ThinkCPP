  <p>A good approach to problems like this is to think of simple functions
            that are easy to write, and that might turn out to be useful. Then you
            can combine them into a solution. This approach is sometimes called
            <term>bottom-up design</term>. Of course, it is not easy to know ahead of time
            which functions are likely to be useful, but as you gain experience you
            will have a better idea.</p>
  <p>Also, it is not always obvious what sort of things are easy to write,
            but a good approach is to look for subproblems that fit a pattern you
            have seen before.</p>
  <p>Back in <number_reference internal="True" refuri="../Chapter7/looping_and_counting#loopcount" title="Section %s"><inline classes="std std-numref">Section 7.9</inline></number_reference> we looked at a loop that
            traversed a string and counted the number of times a given letter
            appeared. You can think of this program as an example of a pattern
            called <q>traverse and count.</q> The elements of this pattern are:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A set or container that can be traversed, like a string or a vector.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A test that you can apply to each element in the container.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A counter that keeps track of how many elements pass the test.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>In this case, I have a function in mind called <c>howMany</c> that counts
            the number of elements in a vector that equal a given value. The
            parameters are the vector and the integer value we are looking for. The
            return value is the number of times the value appears.</p>
  <program>int howMany (const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vec, int value) {
  int count = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(); i++) {
    if (vec[i] == value) count++;
  }
  return count;
}</program>

      <p>Take a look at the active code below which uses the <c>howMany</c> function. Run the
            code to see how many times the target appears in the vector! Feel free to
