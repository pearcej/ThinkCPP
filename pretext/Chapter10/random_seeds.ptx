  <title>Random seeds</title>
  <p>If you have run the code in this chapter a few times, you might have
            noticed that you are getting the same <q>random</q> values every time. That's
            not very random!</p>
  <p>One of the properties of pseudorandom number generators is that if they
            start from the same place they will generate the same sequence of
            values. The starting place is called a <term>seed</term>; by default, C++ uses
            the same seed every time you run the program.</p>
  <p>While you are debugging, it is often helpful to see the same sequence
            over and over. That way, when you make a change to the program you can
            compare the output before and after the change.</p>
  <p>If you want to choose a different seed for the random number generator,
            you can use the <c>srand</c> function. It takes a single argument, which is
            an integer between 0 and <c>RAND_MAX</c>.</p>
  <p>For many applications, like games, you want to see a different random
            sequence every time the program runs. A common way to do that is to use
            a library function like <c>gettimeofday</c> to generate something
            reasonably unpredictable and unrepeatable, like the number of
            milliseconds since the last second tick, and use that number as a seed.
            The details of how to do that depend on your development environment.</p>
