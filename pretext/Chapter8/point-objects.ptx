  <title><c>Point</c> objects</title>
  <p>As a simple example of a compound structure, consider the concept of a
            mathematical point. At one level, a point is two numbers (coordinates)
            that we treat collectively as a single object. In mathematical notation,
            points are often written in parentheses, with a comma separating the
            coordinates. For example, <m>(0, 0)</m> indicates the origin, and
            <m>(x, y)</m> indicates the point <m>x</m> units to the right and
            <m>y</m> units up from the origin.</p>
  <p>A natural way to represent a point in C++ is with two <c>double</c>s. The
            question, then, is how to group these two values into a compound object,
            or structure. The answer is a <c>struct</c> definition:</p>
  <program>struct Point {
  double x, y;
};</program>
  <p><c>struct</c> definitions appear outside of any function definition,
            usually at the beginning of the program (after the <c>include</c>
            statements).</p>
  <p>This definition indicates that there are two elements in this structure,
            named <c>x</c> and <c>y</c>. These elements are called <term>instance variables</term>,
            for reasons I will explain a little later.</p>
  <warning>
    <p>It is a common error to leave off the semi-colon at the end of a
                structure definition. It might seem odd to put a semi-colon after a
                squiggly-brace, but you'll get used to it.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>Once you have defined the new structure, you can create variables with
            that type:</p>
  <program>Point blank;
blank.x = 3.0;
blank.y = 4.0;</program>
  <p>The first line is a conventional variable declaration: <c>blank</c> has
            type <c>Point</c>. The next two lines initialize the instance variables of
            the structure. The <q>dot notation</q> used here is similar to the syntax for
            invoking a function on an object, as in <c>fruit.length()</c>. Of course,
            one difference is that function names are always followed by an argument
            list, even if it is empty.</p>
  <p>The result of these assignments is shown in the following state diagram:</p>
  <figure align="center" xml:id="empty-324">
    <image source="Chapter8/Images/8.2stackdiagram.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
  </figure>
  <p>As usual, the name of the variable <c>blank</c> appears outside the box and
            its value appears inside the box. In this case, that value is a compound
            object with two named instance variables.</p>
