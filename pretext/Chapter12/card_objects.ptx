  <title><c>Card</c> objects</title>
  <p>If you are not familiar with common playing cards, now would be a good
            time to get a deck, or else this chapter might not make much sense.
            There are 52 cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits
            and one of 13 ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs
            (in descending order in Bridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
            9, 10, Jack, Queen and King. Depending on what game you are playing, the
            rank of the Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.</p>
  <p>If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is
            pretty obvious what the instance variables should be: <c>rank</c> and
            <c>suit</c>. It is not as obvious what type the instance variables should
            be. One possibility is <c>string</c>s, containing things like
            <c>"Spade"</c> for suits and <c>"Queen"</c> for ranks. One problem with this
            implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to see
            which had higher rank or suit.</p>
  <p>An alternative is to use integers to <term>encode</term> the ranks and suits. By
            <q>encode,</q> I do not mean what some people think, which is to encrypt, or
            translate into a secret code. What a computer scientist means by
            <q>encode</q> is something like <q>define a mapping between a sequence of
            numbers and the things I want to represent.</q> For example,</p>

  <p>The symbol <math>\mapsto</math> is mathematical notation for <q>maps to.</q> The
            obvious feature of this mapping is that the suits map to integers in
            order, so we can compare suits by comparing integers. The mapping for
            ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the
            corresponding integer, and for face cards:</p>

  <p>The reason I am using mathematical notation for these mappings is that
            they are not part of the C++ program. They are part of the program
            design, but they never appear explicitly in the code. The class
            definition for the <c>Card</c> type looks like this:</p>
  <pre>struct Card {
  int suit, rank;

  Card ();
  Card (int s, int r);
};

Card::Card () {
  suit = 0;  rank = 0;
}

Card::Card (int s, int r) {
  suit = s;  rank = r;
}</pre>
  <p>There are two constructors for <c>Card</c>s. You can tell that they are
            constructors because they have no return type and their name is the same
            as the name of the structure. The first constructor takes no arguments
            and initializes the instance variables to a useless value (the zero of
            clubs).</p>
  <p>The second constructor is more useful. It takes two parameters, the suit
            and rank of the card.</p>
  <p>The following code creates an object named <c>threeOfClubs</c> that
            represents the 3 of Clubs:</p>
  <pre>Card threeOfClubs (0, 3);</pre>
  <p>The first argument, <c>0</c> represents the suit Clubs, the second,
            naturally, represents the rank 3.</p>
