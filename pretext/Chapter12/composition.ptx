  <title>Composition</title>
  <p>By now we have seen several examples of <term>composition</term> (the ability to
            combine language features in a variety of arrangements). One of the
            first examples we saw was using a function invocation as part of an
            expression. Another example is the nested structure of statements: you
            can put an <c>if</c> statement within a <c>while</c> loop, or within another
            <c>if</c> statement, etc.</p>
  <p>Having seen this pattern, and having learned about vectors and objects,
            you should not be surprised to learn that you can have vectors of
            objects. In fact, you can also have objects that contain vectors (as
            instance variables); you can have vectors that contain vectors; you can
            have objects that contain objects, and so on.</p>
  <p>In the next two chapters we will look at some examples of these
            combinations, using <c>Card</c> objects as a case study.</p>
