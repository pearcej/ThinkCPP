  <title>Vectors of cards</title>
  <p>The reason I chose <c>Cards</c> as the objects for this chapter is that
            there is an obvious use for a vector of cards&#x2014;a deck. Here is some code
            that creates a new deck of 52 cards:</p>
  <pre>vector&lt;Card&gt; deck (52);</pre>
  <p>Here is the state diagram for this object:</p>
  <figure align="center" xml:id="empty-66">
    <image source="Chapter12/Images/12.6deck_state_diagram.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
  </figure>
  <p>The three dots represent the 48 cards I didn't feel like drawing. Keep
            in mind that we haven't initialized the instance variables of the cards
            yet. In some environments, they will get initialized to zero, as shown
            in the figure, but in others they could contain any possible value.</p>
  <p>One way to initialize them would be to pass a <c>Card</c> as a second
            argument to the constructor:</p>
  <pre>Card aceOfSpades (3, 1);
vector&lt;Card&gt; deck (52, aceOfSpades);</pre>
  <p>This code builds a deck with 52 identical cards, like a special deck for
            a magic trick. Of course, it makes more sense to build a deck with 52
            different cards in it. To do that we use a nested loop.</p>
  <p>The outer loop enumerates the suits, from 0 to 3. For each suit, the
            inner loop enumerates the ranks, from 1 to 13. Since the outer loop
            iterates 4 times, and the inner loop iterates 13 times, the total number
            of times the body is executed is 52 (13 times 4).</p>
  <pre>int i = 0;
for (int suit = 0; suit &lt;= 3; suit++) {
  for (int rank = 1; rank &lt;= 13; rank++) {
    deck[i].suit = suit;
    deck[i].rank = rank;
    i++;
  }
}</pre>
  <p>I used the variable <c>i</c> to keep track of where in the deck the next
            card should go.</p>
  <p>Notice that we can compose the syntax for selecting an element from an
            array (the <c>[]</c> operator) with the syntax for selecting an instance
            variable from an object (the dot operator). The expression
            <c>deck[i].suit</c> means <q>the suit of the ith card in the deck</q>.</p>
  <p>This deck-building code is encapsulated in a function called
            <c>buildDeck</c> that takes no parameters and that returns a
            fully-populated vector of <c>Card</c>s.</p>
