  <title>The <c>equals</c> function</title>
  <p>In order for two cards to be equal, they have to have the same rank and
            the same suit. Unfortunately, the <c>==</c> operator does not work for
            user-defined types like <c>Card</c>, so we have to write a function that
            compares two cards. We'll call it <c>equals</c>. It is also possible to
            write a new definition for the <c>==</c> operator, but we will not cover
            that in this book.</p>
  <p>It is clear that the return value from <c>equals</c> should be a boolean
            that indicates whether the cards are the same. It is also clear that
            there have to be two <c>Card</c>s as parameters. But we have one more
            choice: should <c>equals</c> be a member function or a free-standing
            function?</p>
  <p>As a member function, it looks like this:</p>
  <program>bool Card::equals (const Card&amp; c2) const {
  return (rank == c2.rank &amp;&amp; suit == c2.suit);
}</program>
  <p>To use this function, we have to invoke it on one of the cards and pass
            the other as an argument:</p>
  <program>Card card1 (1, 11);
Card card2 (1, 11);

if (card1.equals(card2)) {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Yup, that's the same card." &lt;&lt; endl;
}</program>
  <p>This method of invocation always seems strange to me when the function
            is something like <c>equals</c>, in which the two arguments are symmetric.
            What I mean by symmetric is that it does not matter whether I ask <q>Is A
            equal to B?</q> or <q>Is B equal to A?</q> In this case, I think it looks better
            to rewrite <c>equals</c> as a nonmember function:</p>
  <program>bool equals (const Card&amp; c1, const Card&amp; c2) {
  return (c1.rank == c2.rank &amp;&amp; c1.suit == c2.suit);
}</program>
  <p>When we call this version of the function, the arguments appear
            side-by-side in a way that makes more logical sense, to me at least.</p>
  <program>if (equals (card1, card2)) {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Yup, that's the same card." &lt;&lt; endl;
}</program>
  <p>Of course, this is a matter of taste. My point here is that you should
            be comfortable writing both member and nonmember functions, so that you
            can choose the interface that works best depending on the circumstance.</p>
