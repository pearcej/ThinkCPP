  <title>Bisection search</title>
  <p>If the cards in the deck are not in order, there is no way to search
    that is faster than the linear search. We have to look at every card,
    since otherwise there is no way to be certain the card we want is not
    there.</p>
  <p>But when you look for a word in a dictionary, you don't search linearly through every word. The
    reason is that the words are in alphabetical order. As a result, you probably use an algorithm
    that is similar to a <term>bisection search</term>:</p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Start in the middle somewhere.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Choose a word on the page and compare it to the word you are looking
          for.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you found the word you are looking for, stop.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the word you are looking for comes after the word on the page,
          flip to somewhere later in the dictionary and go to step 2.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the word you are looking for comes before the word on the page,
          flip to somewhere earlier in the dictionary and go to step 2.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>If you ever get to the point where there are two adjacent words on the
    page and your word comes between them, you can conclude that your word
    is not in the dictionary. The only alternative is that your word has
    been misfiled somewhere, but that contradicts our assumption that the
    words are in alphabetical order.</p>
  <p>In the case of a deck of cards, if we know that the cards are in order, we can write a version
    of <c>find</c> that is much faster. The best way to write a bisection search is with a recursive
    function. That's because bisection is naturally recursive.</p>
  <p>The trick is to write a function called <c>findBisect</c> that takes two indices as parameters, <c>low</c>
    and <c>high</c>, indicating the segment of the vector that should be searched (including both <c>low</c>
    and <c>high</c>).</p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>To search the vector, choose an index between <c>low</c> and <c>high</c>, and call it <c>mid</c>.
          Compare the card at <c>mid</c> to the card you are looking for.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you found it, stop.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the card at <c>mid</c> is higher than your card, search in the range from <c>low</c> to <c>mid-1</c>
          .</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the card at <c>mid</c> is lower than your card, search in the range from <c>mid+1</c> to <c>high</c>
          .</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Steps 3 and 4 look suspiciously like recursive invocations. Here's what
    this all looks like translated into C++:</p>
  <program>int findBisect(const Card&amp; card, const vector&lt;Card&gt;&amp; deck,
                int low, int high) {
  int mid = (high + low) / 2;

  // if we found the card, return its index
  if (equals(deck[mid], card)) return mid;

  // otherwise, compare the card to the middle card
  if (deck[mid].isGreater (card)) {
    // search the first half of the deck
    return findBisect (card, deck, low, mid-1);
  } else {
    // search the second half of the deck
    return findBisect (card, deck, mid+1, high);
  }
}</program>
  <p>Although this code contains the kernel of a bisection search, it is still missing a piece. As
    it is currently written, if the card is not in the deck, it will recurse forever. We need a way
    to detect this condition and deal with it properly (by returning <c>-1</c>).</p>
  <p>The easiest way to tell that your card is not in the deck is if there are <em>no</em> cards in
    the deck, which is the case if <c>high</c> is less than <c>low</c>. Well, there are still cards in the
    deck, of course, but what I mean is that there are no cards in the segment of the deck indicated
    by <c>low</c> and <c>high</c>.</p>
  <p>With that line added, the function works correctly:</p>
  <program>int findBisect(const Card&amp; card, const vector&lt;Card&gt;&amp; deck,
                int low, int high) {

  cout &lt;&lt; low &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; high &lt;&lt; endl;

  if (high &lt; low) return -1;

  int mid = (high + low) / 2;

  if (equals(deck[mid], card)) return mid;

  if (deck[mid].isGreater (card)) {
    return findBisect (card, deck, low, mid-1);
  } else {
    return findBisect (card, deck, mid+1, high);
  }
}</program>
  <p>I added an output statement at the beginning so I could watch the
    sequence of recursive calls and convince myself that it would eventually
    reach the base case. I tried out the following code:</p>
  <program>
cout &lt;&lt; findBisect (deck[23], deck, 0, 51);
</program>
  <p>And got the following output:</p>
  <console><output>0, 51
0, 24
13, 24
19, 24
22, 24
I found the card at index = 23</output></console>
  <p>Then I made up a card that is not in the deck(the 15 of Diamonds), and
    tried to find it. I got the following:</p>
  <console><output>0, 51
0, 24
13, 24
13, 17
13, 14
13, 12
I found the card at index = -1</output></console>
  <p>These tests don't prove that this program is correct. In fact, no amount
    of testing can prove that a program is correct. On the other hand, by
    looking at a few cases and examining the code, you might be able to
    convince yourself.</p>

  <p>The number of recursive calls is fairly small, typically 6 or 7. That means we only had to call <c>equals</c>
    and <c>isGreater</c> 6 or 7 times, compared to up to 52 times if we did a linear search. In general,
    bisection is much faster than a linear search, especially for large vectors.</p>
  <p>Two common errors in recursive programs are forgetting to include a base
    case and writing the recursive call so that the base case is never
    reached. Either error will cause an infinite recursion, in which case
    C++ will (eventually) generate a run-time error.</p>
