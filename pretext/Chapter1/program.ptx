  <title>What is a Program?</title>
  <p>A <term>program</term> is a sequence of instructions that specifies
    how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a
    system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic
    computation, like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a
    program.</p>
  <p>The instructions (or commands, or statements) look different in
    different programming languages, but there are a few basic functions
    that appear in just about every language:</p>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>input:</title>
      <p>Get data from the keyboard, or a file, or some other device.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>output:</title>
      <p>Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>math:</title>
      <p>Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
        multiplication.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>testing:</title>
      <p>Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of
        statements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>repetition:</title>
      <p>Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <p>Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every program
    you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of functions
    that look more or less like these. Thus, one way to describe programming
    is the process of breaking a large, complex task up into smaller and
    smaller subtasks until eventually the subtasks are simple enough to be
    performed with one of these simple functions.</p>
