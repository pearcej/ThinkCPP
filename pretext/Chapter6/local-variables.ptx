  <title>Local variables</title>
  <p>About this time, you might be wondering how we can use the same variable
            <c>i</c> in both <c>printMultiples</c> and <c>printMultTable</c>. Didn't I say
            that you can only declare a variable once? And doesn't it cause problems
            when one of the functions changes the value of the variable?</p>
  <p>The answer to both questions is <q>no,</q> because the <c>i</c> in
            <c>printMultiples</c> and the <c>i</c> in <c>printMultTable</c> are <em>not the same
                variable</em>. They have the same name, but they do not refer to the same
            storage location, and changing the value of one of them has no effect on
            the other.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Remember that variables that are declared inside a function definition
                are local. You cannot access a local variable from outside its <q>home</q>
                function, and you are free to have multiple variables with the same
                name, as long as they are not in the same function scope.</p>
  </note>
  <p>The stack diagram for this program shows clearly that the two variables
            named <c>i</c> are not in the same storage location. They can have
            different values, and changing one does not affect the other.</p>

    <image source="Chapter6/Images/6.9stackdiagram.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
  </figure>
  <p>Notice that the value of the parameter <c>n</c> in <c>printMultiples</c> has
            to be the same as the value of <c>i</c> in <c>printMultTable</c>. On the other
            hand, the value of <c>i</c> in <c>printMultiples</c> goes from 1 up to <c>n</c>.
            In the diagram, it happens to be 3. The next time through the loop it
            will be 4.</p>
  <p>It is often a good idea to use different variable names in different
            functions, to avoid confusion, but there are good reasons to reuse
            names. For example, it is common to use the names <c>i</c>, <c>j</c> and <c>k</c>
            as loop variables. If you avoid using them in one function just because
            you used them somewhere else, you will probably make the program harder
            to read.</p>
