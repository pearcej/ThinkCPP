  <title>File Input/Output and <c>matrix</c>es</title>
  <p>In this chapter we will develop a program that reads and writes files,
            parses input, and demonstrates the <c>matrix</c> class. We will also
            implement a data structure called <c>Set</c> that expands automatically as
            you add elements.</p>
  <p>Aside from demonstrating all these features, the real purpose of the
            program is to generate a two-dimensional table of the distances between
            cities in the United States. The output is a matrix that looks like this:</p>
  <program>Atlanta 0
Chicago 700     0
Boston  1100    1000    0
Dallas  800     900     1750    0
Denver  1450    1000    2000    800     0
Detroit 750     300     800     1150    1300    0
Orlando 400     1150    1300    1100    1900    1200    0
Phoenix 1850    1750    2650    1000    800     2000    2100    0
Seattle 2650    2000    3000    2150    1350    2300    3100    1450    0
        Atlanta Chicago Boston  Dallas  Denver  Detroit Orlando Phoenix Seattle</program>
  <p>The diagonal elements are all zero because that is the distance from a
            city to itself. Also, because the distance from A to B is the same as
            the distance from B to A, there is no need to print the top half of the
            matrix.</p>

      <p>Why aren't we filling in every value in our table, who are we leaving blank space above the diagonal of 0's?</p>

          <p>Incorrect! All of the data above the 0 diagonal is a mirror image of the triangle! So, the triangle contains the whole dataset.</p>

          <p>Correct! The triangle contains all data points with no repeat data. If we included all datapoints, the would just be repeats of the points we already have.</p>
