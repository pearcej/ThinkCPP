  <title>Containers for strings</title>
  <p>We have seen five types of values&#x2014;booleans, characters, integers,
            floating-point numbers and strings&#x2014;but only four types of
            variables&#x2014;<c>bool</c>, <c>char</c>, <c>int</c> and <c>double</c>. So far we have no
            way to store a string in a variable or perform operations on strings.</p>
  <p>In fact, there are several kinds of variables in C++ that can store
            strings. One is a basic type that is part of the C++ language, sometimes
            called <q>a native C string.</q> The syntax for C strings is a bit ugly, and
            using them requires some concepts we have not covered yet, so for the
            most part we are going to avoid them.</p>
  <p>The string type we are going to use is called <c>string</c>, which is one
            of the classes that belong to the C++ Standard Library.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to avoid C strings altogether. In a
            few places in this chapter I will warn you about some problems you might
            run into using <c>string</c>s instead of C strings.</p>
