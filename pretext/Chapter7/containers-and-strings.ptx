  <title>Containers for strings</title>
  <p>We have seen five types of values&#x2014;booleans, characters, integers, floating-point numbers
    and strings&#x2014;but only four types of variables&#x2014;<c>bool</c>, <c>char</c>, <c>int</c> and <c>double</c>.
    So far we have no way to store a string in a variable or perform operations on strings.</p>
  <p>In fact, there are several kinds of variables in C++ that can store strings. One is a basic
    type that is part of the C++ language, sometimes called <q>a native C string.</q> The syntax for
    C strings is a bit ugly, and using them requires some concepts we have not covered yet, so for
    the most part we are going to avoid them.</p>
  <p>The string type we are going to use is called <c>string</c>, which is one of the classes that belong
    to the C++ Standard Library.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to avoid C strings altogether. In a few places in this
    chapter I will warn you about some problems you might run into using <c>string</c>s instead of C
    strings.</p>
