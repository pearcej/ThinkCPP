    <li>
      <title>modulus:</title>
      <p>An operator that works on integers and yields the remainder when one
        number is divided by another. In C++ it is denoted with a percent
        sign (%).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>conditional:</title>
      <p>A block of statements that may or may not be executed depending on
        some condition.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>chaining:</title>
      <p>A way of joining several conditional statements in sequence.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>nesting:</title>
      <p>Putting a conditional statement inside one or both branches of
        another conditional statement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>recursion:</title>
      <p>The process of calling the same function you are currently
        executing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>infinite recursion:</title>
      <p>A function that calls itself recursively without every reaching the
        base case. Eventually an infinite recursion will cause a run-time
        error.</p>
