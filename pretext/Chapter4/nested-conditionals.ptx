  <title>Nested Conditionals</title>
  <p>In addition to chaining, you can also nest one conditional within
            another. We could have written the previous example as:</p>
  <exercise label="nested_conditionals_AC_1">
    <statement>
      <p>This program classifies a number (x) as positive, negative, or zero,
            just like the program on the previous page.  However, this time, we are
            using nested conditionals.</p>
    </statement>
    <program xml:id="nested_conditionals_AC_1_editor" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
      <input><![CDATA[
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    int x = 9;
    if (x == 0) {
        cout << "x is zero" << endl;
    }
    else {
        if (x > 0) {
            cout << "x is positive" << endl;
        }
        else {
            cout << "x is negative" << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;

}
        ]]></input>
    </program>
  </exercise>
  <p>There is now an outer conditional that contains two branches. The first
            branch contains a simple output statement, but the second branch
            contains another if statement, which has two branches of its own.
            Fortunately, those two branches are both output statements, although
            they could have been conditional statements as well.</p>
  <note>
    <p>There is not a limit to the number of times you can nest a conditional.
                However, you should try to limit this number, as it will reduce the
                complexity of your program structure.</p>
  </note>
  <p>Notice again that indentation helps make the structure apparent, but
            nevertheless, nested conditionals get difficult to read very quickly. In
            general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, this kind of <term>nested structure</term> is common, and we
            will see it again, so you better get used to it.</p>
