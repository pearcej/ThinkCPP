  <title>Functions for objects</title>
  <p>In the next few sections, I will demonstrate several possible interfaces
    for functions that operate on objects. For some operations, you will
    have a choice of several possible interfaces, so you should consider the
    pros and cons of each of these:</p>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>pure function:</title>
      <p>Takes objects and/or basic types as arguments but does not modify the
        objects. The return value is either a basic type or a new object
        created inside the function.</p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>modifier:</title>
      <p>Takes objects as parameters and modifies some or all of them. Often
        returns void.</p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>fill-in function:</title>
      <p>One of the parameters is an <q>empty</q> object that gets filled in by the function.
        Technically, this is a type of modifier.</p>
    </li>
  </dl>
  <exercise label="dnd9_1">
    <statement>
      <p>Match the term to its definition.</p>

    <matches>
      <match order="1">
        <premise>pure function</premise>
        <response>Does not modify objects. The return values is either a basic type or a new object
          that was create in the function. Takes objects and/or basic types as arguments.</response>
      </match>
      <match order="2">
        <premise>modifier</premise>
        <response>Often returns void. Modifies some or all parameters. Takes objects as parameters.</response>
      </match>
      <match order="3">
        <premise>fill-in function</premise>
        <response>Technically a type of modifier. One of the parameters is an "empty" object that
          gets filled in by the function.</response>
      </match>
    </matches>
