  <title>Generalization</title>
  <p>In some ways converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than
    just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition
    for dealing with times is better.</p>
  <p>But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers, and make the investment of
    writing the conversion functions (<c>convertToSeconds</c> and <c>makeTime</c>), we get a program that is shorter, easier
    to read and debug, and more reliable.</p>
  <p>It is also easier to add more features later. For example, imagine subtracting two <c>Time</c>s to
    find the duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with
    borrowing. Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.</p>
  <p>Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (more general) makes is
    easier (fewer special cases, fewer opportunities for error).</p>
