  <title>Generalization</title>
  <p>In some ways converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than
            just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition
            for dealing with times is better.</p>
  <p>But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers, and make
            the investment of writing the conversion functions (<c>convertToSeconds</c>
            and <c>makeTime</c>), we get a program that is shorter, easier to read and
            debug, and more reliable.</p>
  <p>It is also easier to add more features later. For example, imagine
            subtracting two <c>Time</c>s to find the duration between them. The naive
            approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing. Using the
            conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.</p>
  <p>Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (more general) makes is
            easier (fewer special cases, fewer opportunities for error).</p>
