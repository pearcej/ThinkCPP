  <title><c>const</c> parameters</title>
  <p>You might have noticed that the parameters for <c>after</c> and <c>addTime</c>
            are being passed by reference. Since these are pure functions, they do
            not modify the parameters they receive, so I could just as well have
            passed them by value.</p>
  <p>The advantage of passing by value is that the calling function and the
            callee are appropriately encapsulated&#x2014;it is not possible for a change in
            one to affect the other, except by affecting the return value.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, passing by reference usually is more efficient,
            because it avoids copying the argument. Furthermore, there is a nice
            feature in C++, called <c>const</c>, that can make reference parameters
            just as safe as value parameters.</p>
  <p>If you are writing a function and you do not intend to modify a
            parameter, you can declare that it is a <term>constant reference
                parameter</term>. The syntax looks like this:</p>
  <pre>void printTime (const Time&amp; time) ...
Time addTime (const Time&amp; t1, const Time&amp; t2) ...</pre>
  <p>I've included only the first line of the functions. If you tell the
            compiler that you don't intend to change a parameter, it can help remind
            you. If you try to change one, you should get a compiler error, or at
            least a warning.</p>
