  <title>Decks</title>
  <p>In the previous chapter, we worked with a vector of objects, but I also
            mentioned that it is possible to have an object that contains a vector
            as an instance variable. In this chapter I am going to create a new
            object, called a <c>Deck</c>, that contains a vector of <c>Card</c>s.</p>
  <p>The structure definition looks like this</p>
  <program>struct Deck {
  vector&lt;Card&gt; cards;

  Deck(int n);
};

Deck::Deck(int size) {
  vector&lt;Card&gt; temp (size);
  cards = temp;
}</program>
  <p>The name of the instance variable is <c>cards</c> to help distinguish the
            <c>Deck</c> object from the vector of <c>Card</c>s that it contains.</p>
  <p>For now there is only one constructor. It creates a local variable named
            <c>temp</c>, which it initializes by invoking the constructor for the
            <c>vector</c> class, passing the size as a parameter. Then it copies the
            vector from <c>temp</c> into the instance variable <c>cards</c>.</p>
  <p>Now we can create a deck of cards like this:</p>
  <program>Deck deck (52);</program>
  <p>Here is a state diagram showing what a <c>Deck</c> object looks like:</p>
  <figure align="center" >
    <image source="Chapter13/Images/13.3stackdiagram.png" width="50%" alt="image"/>
  </figure>
  <p>The object named <c>deck</c> has a single instance variable named
            <c>cards</c>, which is a vector of <c>Card</c> objects. To access the cards in
            a deck we have to compose the syntax for accessing an instance variable
            and the syntax for selecting an element from an array. For example, the
            expression <c>deck.cards[i]</c> is the ith card in the deck, and
            <c>deck.cards[i].suit</c> is its suit. The following loop</p>
  <program>for (int i = 0; i&lt;52; i++) {
  deck.cards[i].print();
}</program>
  <p>demonstrates how to traverse the deck and output each card.</p>
