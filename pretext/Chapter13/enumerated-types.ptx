  <title>Enumerated types</title>
  <p>In the previous chapter I talked about mappings between real-world
    values like rank and suit, and internal representations like integers
    and strings. Although we created a mapping between ranks and integers,
    and between suits and integers, I pointed out that the mapping itself
    does not appear as part of the program.</p>
  <p>Actually, C++ provides a feature called an <term>enumerated type</term> that makes it possible
    to (1) include a mapping as part of the program, and (2) define the set of values that make up
    the mapping. For example, here is the definition of the enumerated types <c>Suit</c> and <c>Rank</c>:</p>
  <program>enum Suit { CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES };

enum Rank { ACE = 1, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE,
TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING };</program>
  <note>
    <p>By default, the first value in the enumerated type maps to 0, the
      second to 1, and so on.</p>
  </note>
  <p>Within the <c>Suit</c> type, the value <c>CLUBS</c> is represented by the integer 0, <c>DIAMONDS</c> is
    represented by 1, etc.</p>
  <p>The definition of <c>Rank</c> overrides the default mapping and specifies that <c>ACE</c> should be
    represented by the integer 1. The other values follow in the usual way.</p>
  <p>Once we have defined these types, we can use them anywhere. For example, the instance variables <c>rank</c>
    and <c>suit</c> are can be declared with type <c>Rank</c> and <c>Suit</c>:</p>
  <program>struct Card {
  Rank rank;
  Suit suit;

  Card(Suit s, Rank r);
};</program>
  <p>The types of the parameters for the constructor have changed, too.
    Now, to create a card, we can use the values from the enumerated type as
    arguments:</p>
  <program>
Card card (DIAMONDS, JACK);
</program>
  <p>By convention, the values in enumerated types have names with all
    capital letters. This code is much clearer than the alternative using
    integers:</p>
  <program>
Card card (1, 11);
</program>
  <listing label="enum_type_AC_1">
    <caption>
      This active code uses the enumerated types created above to construct <c>Card</c> objects. Feel
        free to modify the values that the cards are being initialized to in the constructor: this
        will change the output from the <c>print</c> function. Notice how this is much clearer than using
        integers.

    cout &lt;&lt; ranks[rank] &lt;&lt; " of " &lt;&lt; suits[suit] &lt;&lt; endl;
}

  </listing>
  <p>Because we know that the values in the enumerated types are represented as integers, we can use
    them as indices for a vector. Therefore the old <c>print</c> function will work without modification.
    We have to make some changes in <c>buildDeck</c>, though:</p>
  <program>int index = 0;
for (Suit suit = CLUBS; suit &lt;= SPADES; suit = Suit(suit+1)) {
  for (Rank rank = ACE; rank &lt;= KING; rank = Rank(rank+1)) {
    deck[index].suit = suit;
    deck[index].rank = rank;
    index++;
  }
}</program>
  <p>In some ways, using enumerated types makes this code more readable, but there is one
    complication. Strictly speaking, we are not allowed to do arithmetic with enumerated types, so <c>suit++</c>
    is not legal. On the other hand, in the expression <c>suit+1</c>, C++ automatically converts the
    enumerated type to integer. Then we can take the result and typecast it back to the enumerated
    type:</p>
  <program>suit = Suit(suit+1);
rank = Rank(rank+1);</program>
  <p>Actually, there is a better way to do this&#x2014;we can define the <c>++</c> operator for
    enumerated types&#x2014;but that is beyond the scope of this book.</p>
